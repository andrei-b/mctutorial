# Chapter 2: Bootloader and UART

A bootloader is a special program that runs when the system is powered on. On general-purpose computers, the bootloader's main role is to prepare the hardware and load the operating system. On microcontrollers that do not run an OS, the bootloader is often used to initialize system parameters and make the main program more independent from specific hardware details of the MCU. Standard Arduino boards also include a bootloader, which allows users to upload sketches via a standard serial interface, simplifying development and eliminating the need for external programmers.
