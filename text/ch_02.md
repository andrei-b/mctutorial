# Chapter 2: UART
The Arduino Uno R3 communicates with your PC using UART via a USB connection, which is internally managed by a USB-to-Serial converter chip. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**MCU UART (ATmega328P)**

Pins: TX (Digital Pin 1) and RX (Digital Pin 0)
The microcontroller uses its hardware UART (USART0) to send/receive serial data.
Baud rate and format (8N1: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) are set using registers.

**USB-to-Serial Converter (ATmega16U2)**

Arduino Uno R3 includes a second microcontroller (ATmega16U2) flashed with firmware acting as a USB-to-Serial bridge.
This chip receives UART data from ATmega328P and sends it via USB to your PC.
Conversely, it takes USB data from the PC and sends it via UART to ATmega328P.

When you open or reopen the serial port on the PC, the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) line triggers a reset on the Arduino Uno via a capacitor. This behavior is specific to the Arduino Uno board, not to the ATmega328P or ATmega16U2 chips themselves. It is hardwired into the Unoâ€™s circuitry to allow the Arduino IDE to reset the board automatically before uploading a sketch, and there is no way to turn it off.

Some Arduino boards (like the Leonardo or Mega2560) have separate UARTs for programming and general I/O. However, on the Arduino Uno, if you need a serial port without this Arduino-specific reset behavior, your only option is to emulate UART in software.
