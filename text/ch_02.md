The Arduino Uno R3 communicates with your PC using UART via a USB connection, which is internally managed by a USB-to-Serial converter chip. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**MCU UART (ATmega328P)**

Pins: TX (Digital Pin 1) and RX (Digital Pin 0)
The microcontroller uses its hardware UART (USART0) to send/receive serial data.
Baud rate and format (8N1: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) are set using registers.

**USB-to-Serial Converter (ATmega16U2)**

Both Arduino Uno R3 and Mega include a second microcontroller (ATmega16U2) flashed with firmware acting as a USB-to-Serial bridge.
This chip receives UART data from ATmega328P and sends it via USB to your PC.
Conversely, it takes USB data from the PC and sends it via UART to the MCU. The interface for this UART is the same for both boards, and we will be using it in our cross platform projects.

When you open or reopen the serial port on the PC, the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) line triggers a reset on the Arduino Uno via a capacitor. This behavior is specific to the Arduino Uno board, not to the ATmega328P or ATmega16U2 chips themselves. It is hardwired into the Unoâ€™s circuitry to allow the Arduino IDE to reset the board automatically before uploading a sketch, and there is no way to turn it off.

Some Arduino boards (like the Leonardo or Mega2560) have separate UARTs for programming and general I/O. However, on the Arduino Uno, if you need a serial port without this Arduino-specific reset behavior, your only option is to emulate UART in software.
The code accompanying this chapter allows you to dump, via UART, the contents of the Arduino RAM (SRAM) block specified by the user.
Let's have a look at UART routines which we will be using in many following examples. uart_init sets the baud rate and enables the UART:
```c
void uart_init(uint32_t baud) {
    // Set the baud rate
    uint16_t ubrr = (F_CPU / (16UL * baud)) - 1;
    UBRR0H = (unsigned char)(ubrr >> 8);
    UBRR0L = (unsigned char)(ubrr & 0xFF);

    // Enable receiver and transmitter
    UCSR0B = (1 << RXEN0) | (1 << TXEN0);

    // Set the frame format: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
    UCSR0C = (1 << UCSZ01) | (1 << UCSZ00);
}
```
The 16 bit UBRR register (UBRR0H and UBRR0L bytes) is used to set the baud rate. The UART hardware uses the system clock (`F_CPU`) and divides it by a specific factor to generate the baud rate. The formula for calculating the UBRR value is:
```
     UBRR = F_CPU/(16*baud rate) - 1
```
   The 16 in the formula comes from the default USART clock prescaler. The UBRR value configures the UART's internal clock divider.
   This divider determines how frequently the UART hardware samples the incoming or outgoing data bits to match the desired baud rate.
    The UBRR value indirectly controls the number of clock cycles (or "ticks") between each bit in the UART communication.
    For example, at a baud rate of 9600, each bit lasts approximately 1/9600 of a second. The UBRR value ensures the UART hardware generates this timing by dividing the system clock appropriately.
Send char to the UART:

```c
void uart_send_char(char data) {
    // Wait for empty transmit buffer
    while (!(UCSR0A & (1 << UDRE0))) {
    }
    // Put data into buffer, sends the data
    UDR0 = data;
}
```
UCSR0A is the UART Control and Status Register A. UDRE0 is the Data Register Empty flag (bit in `UCSR0A`). This flag is set to `1` when the transmit buffer is empty and ready to accept new data and cleared when data is written to the transmit buffer.
UDR0 is the data registe. Writing to this register we place the data into the transmit buffer. This function is blocking, meaning it will halt execution until the transmit buffer is ready.

The uart_send_char is simple but not efficient: if we need to send multiple characters the program will be blocked till all of them are sent. When doing real-time programming we often need to be able to perform other actions while writing and reading to and from UART. For this we will need an iterrupt based I/O which we will consider in calter chapters.

The program used as an example in this chapter accesses the Arduinoâ€™s memory, so this is a good opportunity to take a closer look at how that memory is organized. General-purpose computers typically have large amounts of RAM that store both program code and data.
However, some microcontrollers work differently. The Arduino Uno R3 has only 2 KB of SRAM (which you can think of as RAM) and 32 KB of flash memory. Mega has 8 KB and 128 KB respectively. The SRAM is used to store program variables, while the flash memory stores the program code and, if explicitly instructed, constant data. 

:pushpin: In Uno both memory types are addressed using 16 bit addresses that start from 0. In Mega the flash memory is addressed using a 24 bit addresses (that is how it can access more than 64KB of memory). Keep this in mind when you do the pointer arithmetics. 

Usually this does not cause any confusion since you do not work with addresses directly.

Storing and reading data from Flash requires special functons:

```c
#include <avr/pgmspace.h>

const char message[] PROGMEM = "Hello from Flash!";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  char c;
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < sizeof(message); i++) {
    c = pgm_read_byte(&message[i]);
    Serial.print(c);
  }
}

void loop() {}
```
Using `PROGMEM`, you tell the compiler that the `message` bytes should be stored only in flash memory. The place in RAM will not be reserved for them. The pgm_read_byte function is used to read the byte stored at the flash memory address, this and other functions are declared in avr/pgmspace.h. Special `lpm` processor instruction is used to load the byte from the flash into a register:
```
lpm     r0, Z       ; Load program memory at Z into r0
```
When programming Uno, you must set the Z pointer (R30:R31) to the flash memory address.

With Mega it is a bit more complicated, as it requires use of the RAMPZ register to access addresses beyond 0xFFFF.

If you're accessing flash below 64KB, no changes are needed to your Uno code, this will work:

```asm
ldi r31, high(address)
ldi r30, low(address)
lpm r0, Z
```
If you're accessing flash above 64KB, you must set RAMPZ:

```asm
ldi r16, high_byte_of_address_above_64k  ; e.g., for address 0x18000, use 0x03
out RAMPZ, r16

ldi r31, high(0x8000)  ; upper 16-bit address
ldi r30, low(0x8000)
lpm r0, Z              ; read from (RAMPZ<<16) | Z
```

Reading from flash is slower than SRAM, and multibyte reads (e.g., pgm_read_word()) may require address alignment. 

As you probably know, there is a third type of memory in the Arduino Uno R3: EEPROM. It is the slowest of all memory types on the Arduino, but it retains data when the Arduino is turned off and can be written to at runtime. In C the EEPROM can be accessed using the `<EEPROM.h>` library:
```C
struct Config {
  int settingA;
  float settingB;
};

Config config = { 42, 3.14 };
EEPROM.put(0, config);     // Store struct at address 0

Config loaded;
EEPROM.get(0, loaded);     // Load struct from address 0
```
Accessing EEPROM in Assembly is a bit more different than accessing the Flash, you must use the EEPROM I/O registers provided by the microcontroller.

| Register | Address | Description
-----------|---------|----------------
| EEARH	| 0x22 | EEPROM | Address Register High Byte
| EEARL	| 0x21	| EEPROM Address Register Low Byte
| EEDR	| 0x20	EEPROM Data Register
| EECR	| 0x1F	EEPROM Control Register

Bits in EECR:

EERE (bit 0): EEPROM Read Enable

EEPE (bit 1): EEPROM Write Enable

EEMPE (bit 2): Master Write Enable (must be set before EEPE)

EEPM1:0 (bits 5:4): Programming mode (usually 00 for erase+write)

Reading from EEPROM
```asm
; Read EEPROM[0x10] -> R16

ldi  r30, 0x10         ; Address into Z register (EEAR)
out  EEARL, r30
ldi  r30, 0            ; EEARH = 0
out  EEARH, r30

sbi  EECR, EERE        ; Set EERE to trigger EEPROM read
in   r16, EEDR         ; Read data into R16
```
Writing:
```asm
; Write value 0x42 to EEPROM[0x10]

ldi  r30, 0x10         ; Address into EEAR
out  EEARL, r30
ldi  r30, 0
out  EEARH, r30

ldi  r30, 0x42         ; Data to write
out  EEDR, r30

; Wait for any previous write to complete
wait_eeprom:
    sbic EECR, EEPE    ; Skip next if EEPE is clear
    rjmp wait_eeprom   ; Wait if still writing

sbi  EECR, EEMPE       ; Enable master write
sbi  EECR, EEPE        ; Start EEPROM write
```
:pushpin: EEMPE must be set immediately before setting EEPE, within 4 cycles.
