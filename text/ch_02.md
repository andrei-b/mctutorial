# Chapter 2: UART
The Arduino Uno R3 communicates with your PC using UART via a USB connection, which is internally managed by a USB-to-Serial converter chip. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**MCU UART (ATmega328P)**

Pins: TX (Digital Pin 1) and RX (Digital Pin 0)
The microcontroller uses its hardware UART (USART0) to send/receive serial data.
Baud rate and format (8N1: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) are set using registers.

**USB-to-Serial Converter (ATmega16U2)**

Arduino Uno R3 includes a second microcontroller (ATmega16U2) flashed with firmware acting as a USB-to-Serial bridge.
This chip receives UART data from ATmega328P and sends it via USB to your PC.
Conversely, it takes USB data from the PC and sends it via UART to ATmega328P.

Don't use pins 0 and 1 for other purposes when using Serial, as they are connected to UART.
When opening or reopening the serial port the DTR line triggers a reset on the Uno via a capacitor. This behavior is a specific feature of Arduino Uno boards (and not of ATmega328P or ATmega16U2): it allows the Arduino programming software to reset the board by setting the DTR line. It is hardwired into the Arduinoâ€™s circuitry and cannot be changed.
