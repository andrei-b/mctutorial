# Chapter 1. Blinking LED and GPIO Registers
Here is the code:
```c
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>
#define LED_PIN PB5

int main(void) {
    // Set PB5 (pin 13 on Arduino Uno) as output
    DDRB |= (1 << LED_PIN);
    while (1) {
        // Toggle the LED
        PORTB ^= (1 << LED_PIN);
        // Delay for ~1 second
        _delay_ms(1000);
    }
}
```
If you’ve programmed an Arduino before, you should have an idea of what’s going on here. We’re sending periodic signals to pin 13, and if you connect an LED to that pin, you’ll see it blink. The program doesn’t look like a typical Arduino sketch — it resembles a standard C program, and that’s exactly what it is.

The function ```_delay_ms``` from ```util/delay.h``` makes the program wait for the specified number of milliseconds. It uses a simple busy-wait loop, where the number of iterations is calculated based on the processor’s clock speed. In the world of general-purpose computers and multitasking operating systems, busy-waiting is considered inefficient and unreliable, and should generally be avoided. However, in real-time microcontroller development, it is often the only practical way to achieve precise timing delays. We will explore other delay techniques later in this tutorial.

The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) registers are memory-mapped hardware registers in a microcontroller that let your software control and interact with I/O pins.
These registers allow you to:
- Configure pins as input or output
- Read the logic level on input pins
- Set or clear output pins
- Sometimes toggle pins or configure alternate functions

AVR registers are 8-bit wide. Setting or clearing a pin involves writing a byte to a register, where the corresponding bit is set to 1 or 0. The catch is that you cannot access individual bits directly — if you want to change the state of a single pin, you must first read the current value of the register, modify only the bit of interest, and then write the modified byte back to the register.
```c
define PIN 5

// Set pin 5 high
PORTB |= (1 << PIN);  // Read PORTB, set bit 5 to 1, write back

// Set pin 5 low
PORTB &= ~(1 << PIN); // Read PORTB, clear bit 5 to 0, write back
```
The ATmega328P has 23 general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins, organized into three ports:

Port B: PB0 to PB7 — mapped to digital pins D8–D13 and some internal functions (like SPI).

Port C: PC0 to PC6 — mostly used for analog input A0–A5 and I²C (SDA/SCL on PC4/PC5).

Port D: PD0 to PD7 — mapped to digital pins D0–D7 and includes UART RX/TX on PD0/PD1.

Each port has three main registers:

PORTx — output register (write to set pin high/low),

PINx — input register (read to get pin state),

DDRx — data direction register (write to configure pin as input or output).



Let’s take a look at the beginning of the Makefile. 
```makefile
# Makefile for AVR project

# Project name
TARGET = main

# Source files
SRC = main.c

# Microcontroller
MCU = atmega328p

# Clock frequency
F_CPU = 16000000UL

# Programmer and port
PROGRAMMER = usbasp
PORT = /dev/ttyACM0
BAUD = 115200

# Tools
CC = avr-gcc
OBJCOPY = avr-objcopy
AVRDUDE = avrdude
...
```
The first line that you might want to change is:
```
F_CPU = 16000000UL
```
This sets the F_CPU macro to the MCU's clock frequency — in my case, 16 MHz.
If you have an 8 MHz MCU, adjust the value accordingly:
```
F_CPU = 8000000UL
```
Setting the correct F_CPU value is essential for accurate timing calculations, including functions like _delay_ms().
In the world of desktop computers, programs generally don’t need to know the CPU clock speed — but in microcontroller and real-time programming, it’s critical.
The PROGRAMMER variable defines the programmer to be used for flashing by the avrdude utility.
THe command
```bash
avrdude -c ?
```
will give you the list of akk supported devices. 

Now run
```shell
make
```
to build the example, and
```shell
make flash
```
to flash it.
