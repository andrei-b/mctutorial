Let’s take a look at the beginning of the Makefile. 
```makefile
# Makefile for AVR project

# Project name
TARGET = main

# Source files
SRC = main.c

# Microcontroller
MCU = atmega328p

# Clock frequency
F_CPU = 16000000UL

# Programmer and port
PROGRAMMER = usbasp
PORT = /dev/ttyACM0
BAUD = 115200

# Tools
CC = avr-gcc
OBJCOPY = avr-objcopy
AVRDUDE = avrdude
...
```
The first line that you might want to change is:
```
F_CPU = 16000000UL
```
This sets the F_CPU macro to the MCU's clock frequency — in my case, 16 MHz.
If you have an 8 MHz MCU, adjust the value accordingly:
```
F_CPU = 8000000UL
```
Setting the correct F_CPU value is essential for accurate timing calculations, including functions like _delay_ms().
In the world of desktop computers, programs generally don’t need to know the CPU clock speed — but in microcontroller and real-time programming, it’s critical.
The PROGRAMMER variable defines the programmer to be used for flashing by the avrdude utility.
THe command
```bash
avrdude -c ?
```
will give you the list of akk supported devices.
